HyperionDev task L3T05 -  to create a repository for a previously created website.

Task Description:
● You are going to create an online shopping page. The idea behind this task
is to create an online store with products on display. Please implement all
of the below features by making use of Bootstrap in your program.
● Items
  ○ Add 10 items to the page.
  ○ Use the grid system.
  ○ Have your images become responsive (make them change when
  the user moves their mouse over them).
  ○ Have your page display a price and name for each product.
  ○ Include a button under each product to “buy” the product (this does
  not need to be functional yet!)
● Footer
  ○ Create a horizontal form.
  ○ This form should get the contact details of the customer (this does
  not need to be functional yet!)
  ○ Include a small company logo next to the form.
